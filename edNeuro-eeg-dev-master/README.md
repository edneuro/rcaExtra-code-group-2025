## Updates

May 2020: Setting this up as an intermediary location for EEG analysis functions and scripts while we devise a longer-term plan for EdNeuro analysis repositories and toolboxes. Thanks for your patience!

## How to use

This repository should contain code files only, and smaller utility .mat files (e.g, colors.mat). Please do NOT add experimental data files to this repository!

Remember to always pull before grabbing or editing files.

Feel free to **contribute** functions or scripts that you've developed or have been working with that sit outside of main repos (e.g., rcaBase, rcaExtra) used by our group.

Feel free to **edit** functions or scripts and submit a pull request.

If you have questions or issues with a function or script, feel free to **contact** the owner (their email will be in the .m file header).
