# rcaBase
This repository contains code for running Reliable Components Analysis (RCA) in both the time- and frequency domain, and is an extension of code for running RCA in the time-domain, written by Jacek Dmochowski and presented in this paper:

Dmochowski, J. P., Sajda, P., Dias, J., & Parra, L. C. (2012). Correlated components of ongoing EEG point to emotionally laden attentionâ€“a possible marker of engagement?. Frontiers in human neuroscience, 6.

The frequency-domain functionally was originally implemented by Holly Gerhard, with subsequent updates by Peter J. Kohler and others.
